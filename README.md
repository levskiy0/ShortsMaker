# ShortsMaker

**Create viral short-form videos in minutes, not hours.**

ShortsMaker is a desktop application that transforms your ideas into polished vertical videos ready for TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram Reels. No video editing experience required.

## What It Does

Write a script, pick a voice, choose your visuals — ShortsMaker handles the rest. The app automatically generates:

- **Text-to-Speech voiceover** with natural-sounding AI voices
- **Synced subtitles** that highlight words as they're spoken (karaoke-style, typewriter, and more)
- **Smooth transitions** between scenes (fades, slides, zooms, glitches)
- **Animated backgrounds** with Ken Burns effects, slow zoom, pan, and drift
- **Text overlays** with eye-catching animations (pop-in, fire reveal, glitch)

## Key Features

### AI-Powered Workflow
Describe your video idea in plain text and let AI generate complete scenarios — scenes, voiceover scripts, backgrounds, and overlay suggestions. Review, tweak, and render.

### Real-Time Preview
See your video come to life as you edit. ThreeJS-powered renderer delivers smooth 60fps playback with all effects applied.

### Multiple Scenarios
Work on several versions of the same video simultaneously. A/B test different scripts, voices, or visual styles before committing.

### Export Anywhere
Render to MP4, WebM, or MOV in resolutions from mobile-friendly to 4K. Background music with automatic ducking keeps your voiceover clear.

### Aspect Ratios for Every Platform
- 9:16 for TikTok, Shorts, Reels
- 16:9 for YouTube
- 1:1 for Instagram feed
- 4:5 for Instagram portrait
- And more

## The Mission

Professional video production tools are complex, expensive, and time-consuming. Short-form content demands speed. ShortsMaker bridges this gap — giving creators a focused tool that does one thing exceptionally well: turning ideas into scroll-stopping vertical videos.

Whether you're a content creator, marketer, educator, or just someone with a story to tell — your next viral short is just a few clicks away.
